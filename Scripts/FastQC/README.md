#### QC with fastQC

The script **fastqc.sh** shows the steps to perform QC. The input files are from the directory: **/data/reddylab/Flowcells/GGR/rna_seq/Reddy_4557_171219A3** and the files used are A549_FOXO3_OE-RNA_seq-dex-00h-rep1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz and A549_FOXO3_OE-RNA_seq-dex-00h-rep1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz. 

Inorder to prevent duplication in the actual directory, the files have been moved to one of the practice directories in /data/reddylab/Revathy. 

The above script generates 2 html files with the QC report. Refer [Wiki](https://github.com/DukeCAGT/bioinfo_tasks/wiki/QC-Reads) for more details.
